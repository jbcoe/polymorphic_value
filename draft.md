## TL;DR

Add a class template, `polymorphic_value<T>`, to the standard library to support
polymorphic objects with value-like semantics.

## Introduction

The class template, `polymorphic_value`, confers value-like semantics on a
free-store allocated object.  A `polymorphic_value<T>` may hold an object of a
class publicly derived from T, and copying the `polymorphic_value<T>` will copy
the object of the derived type.

## Motivation: Composite objects

Use of components in the design of object-oriented class hierarchies can aid
modular design as components can be potentially re-used as building-blocks for
other composite classes.

We can write a simple composite object formed from two components as follows:

    // Simple composite
    class CompositeObject_1 {
      Component1 c1_;
      Component2 c2_;

     public:
      CompositeObject_1(const Component1& c1,
                        const Component2& c2) :
                        c1_(c1), c2_(c2) {}

      void foo() { c1_.foo(); }
      void bar() { c2_.bar(); }
    };

The composite object can be made more flexible by storing pointers to objects
allowing it to take derived components in its constructor.  (We store pointers
to the components rather than references so that we can take ownership of
them).

    // Non-copyable composite with polymorphic components (BAD)
    class CompositeObject_2 {
      IComponent1* c1_;
      IComponent2* c2_;

     public:
      CompositeObject_2(const IComponent1* c1,
                        const IComponent2* c2) :
                        c1_(c1), c2_(c2) {}

      void foo() { c1_->foo(); }
      void bar() { c2_->bar(); }

      CompositeObject_2(const CompositeObject_2&) = delete;
      CompositeObject_2& operator=(const CompositeObject_2&) = delete;

      CompositeObject_2(CompositeObject_2&& o) : c1_(o.c1_), c2_(o.c2_) {
        o.c1_ = nullptr;
        o.c2_ = nullptr;
      }

      CompositeObject_2& operator=(CompositeObject_2&& o) {
        delete c1_;
        delete c2_;
        c1_ = o.c1_;
        c2_ = o.c2_;
        o.c1_ = nullptr;
        o.c2_ = nullptr;
      }

      ~CompositeObject_2()
      {
        delete c1_;
        delete c2_;
      }
    };

`CompositeObject_2`'s constructor API is unclear without knowing that the class
takes ownership of the objects. We are forced to explicitly suppress the
compiler-generated copy constructor and copy assignment operator to avoid
double-deletion of the components `c1_` and `c2_`. We also need to write a move
constructor and move assignment operator.

Using `unique_ptr` makes ownership clear and saves us writing or deleting
compiler generated methods:

    // Non-copyable composite with polymorphic components
    class CompositeObject_3 {
      std::unique_ptr<IComponent1> c1_;
      std::unique_ptr<IComponent2> c2_;

     public:
      CompositeObject_3(std::unique_ptr<IComponent1> c1,
                        std::unique_ptr<IComponent2> c2) :
                        c1_(std::move(c1)), c2_(std::move(c2)) {}

      void foo() { c1_->foo(); }
      void bar() { c2_->bar(); }
    };

The design of `CompositeObject_3` is good unless we want to copy the object.

We can avoid having to define our own copy constructor by using shared
pointers.  As `shared-ptr`'s copy constructor is shallow, we need to modify the
component pointers to be pointers-to `const` to avoid introducing shared mutable
state [S.Parent].

    // Copyable composite with immutable polymorphic components class
    class CompositeObject_4 {
      std::shared_ptr<const IComponent1> c1_;
      std::shared_ptr<const IComponent2> c2_;

     public:
      CompositeObject_4(std::shared_ptr<const IComponent1> c1,
                        std::shared_ptr<const IComponent2> c2) :
                        c1_(std::move(c1)), c2_(std::move(c2)) {}

      void foo() { c1_->foo(); }
      void bar() { c2_->bar(); }
    };

`CompositeObject_4` has polymorphism and compiler-generated destructor, copy,
move and assignment operators. As long as the components are not mutated, this
design is good. If non-const methods of components are used then this won't
compile.

Using `polymorphic_value` a copyable composite object with polymorphic
components can be written as:

    // Copyable composite with mutable polymorphic components
    class CompositeObject_5 {
      std::polymorphic_value<IComponent1> c1_;
      std::polymorphic_value<IComponent2> c2_;

     public:
      CompositeObject_5(std::polymorphic_value<IComponent1> c1,
                        std::polymorphic_value<IComponent2> c2) :
                        c1_(std::move(c1)), c2_(std::move(c2)) {}

      void foo() { c1_->foo(); }
      void bar() { c2_->bar(); }
    };

The component `c1_` can be constructed from an instance of any class that
inherits from `IComponent1`.  Similarly, `c2_` can be constructed from an
instance of any class that inherits from `IComponent2`.

`CompositeObject_5` has a compiler-generated destructor, copy constructor, move
constructor, assignment operator and move assignment operator. All of these
compiler-generated functions will behave correctly.

## Deep copies

To allow correct copying of polymorphic objects, `polymorphic_value` uses the
copy constructor of the derived-type pointee when copying a base type
`polymorphic_value`.  Similarly, to allow correct destruction of polymorphic
component objects, `polymorphic_value` uses the destructor of the derived-type
pointee in the destructor of a base type `polymorphic_value`.

The requirements of deep-copying can be illustrated by some simple test code:
```
// GIVEN base and derived classes.
class Base { virtual void foo() const = 0; };
class Derived : public Base { void foo() const override {} };

// WHEN a polymorphic_value to base is formed from a derived pointer
polymorphic_value<Base> poly(new Derived());
// AND the polymorphic_value to base is copied.
auto poly_copy = poly;

// THEN the copy points to a distinct object
assert(&*poly != &*poly_copy);
// AND the copy points to a derived type.
assert(dynamic_cast<Derived*>(*&poly_copy));
```

Note that while deep-destruction of a derived class object from a base class
pointer can be performed with a virtual destructor, the same is not true for
deep-copying. `C++` has no concept of a virtual copy constructor and we are not
proposing its addition.  The class template `shared_ptr` already implements
deep-destruction without needing virtual destructors: deep-destruction and
deep-copying can be implemented using type-erasure [Impl].

## Pointer constructor
`polymorphic_value` can be constructed from a pointer and optionally a copier
and/or deleter. The `polymorphic_value` constructed in this manner takes
ownership of the pointer. This constructor is potentially dangerous as a
mismatch in the dynamic and static type of the pointer will result in
incorrectly synthesized copiers and deleters, potentially resulting in slicing
when copying and incomplete deletion during destruction.

```
class Base { /* methods and members */ };
class Derived : public Base { /* methods and members */ };

Derived d = new Derived();
Base* p = d; // static type and dynamic type differ
polymorphic_value<Base> poly(p);

// This copy will have been made using Base's copy constructor.
polymorphic_value<Base> poly_copy = poly;

// Destruction of poly and poly_copy uses Base's destructor.
```

While this is potentially error prone, we have elected to trust users with the
tools they are given. `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr` have similar constructors
and issues.  There are more constructors for `polymorphic_value` of a less
expert-friendly nature that do not present such dangers including a factory
method `make_polymorphic_value`.

Static analysis tools can be written to find cases where static and dynamic
types for pointers passed in to `polymorphic_value` constructors are not
provably identical.

If the user has not supplied a custom copier or deleter, an exception
`bad_polymorphic_value_construction` is thrown from the pointer-constructor if
the dynamic and static types of the pointer argument do not agree.
In cases where the user has supplied a custom copier or deleter it is assumed
that they will do so to avoid slicing and incomplete destruction: a class
heirarchy with a custom `Clone` method and virtual desctructor would make use
of `Clone` in a user-supplied copier.


## Empty state
`polymorphic_value` presents an empty state as it is desirable for it to be
cheaply constructed and then later assigned.  In addition, it may not be
possible to construct the `T` of a `polymorphic_value<T>` if it is an abstract
class (a common intended use pattern).  While permitting an empty state will
necessitate occasional checks for `null`, `polymorphic_value` is intended to
replace uses of pointers or smart pointers where such checks are also
necessary. The benefits of default constructability (use in vectors and maps)
outweigh the costs of a possible empty state.

## Lack of hashing and comparisons
For a given user-defined type, `T`, there are multiple strategies to make
`polymorphic_value<T>` hashable and comparable.  Without requiring additional
named member functions on the type, `T`, or mandating that `T` has virtual
functions and RTTI, the authors do not see how `polymorphic_value` can
generically support hashing or comparisons. Incurring a cost for functionality
that is not required goes against the 'pay for what you use' philosophy of
`C++`.

For a given user-defined type `T` the user is free to specialize
`std::hash` and implement comparison operators for `polymorphic_value<T>`.

## Custom copiers and deleters
The resource management performed by `polymorphic_value` - copying and
destruction of the managed object - can be customized by supplying a _copier_
and _deleter_.  If no copier or deleter is supplied then a default copier or
deleter will be used.

The default deleter is already defined by the standard library and used by
`unique_ptr`.

We define the default copier in technical specifications below.


## Allocator Support

The design of `polymorphic_value` is similar to that of `std::any` which does
not have support for allocators.

`polymorphic_value`, like `std::any` and `std::function` is implemented in
terms of type-erasure. There are technical issues with storing an allocator in
a type-erased context and recovering it later for allocations needed during
copy assignment [P0302r1].

Until such technical obstacles can be overcome, `polymorphic_value` will follow
the design of `std::any` and `std::function` (post C++17)  and will not support
allocators.


## Design changes from `cloned_ptr`
The design of `polymorphic_value` is based upon `cloned_ptr` and modified
following advice from LEWG. The authors (Who unreservedly agree with the design
direction suggested by LEWG) would like to make explicit the cost of these
design changes.

`polymorphic_value<T>` has value-like semantics: copies are deep and `const` is
propagated to the owned object. The first revision of this paper presented
`cloned_ptr<T>` which had mixed pointer/value semantics: copies are deep but
`const` is not propagated to the owned object. `polymorphic_value` can be built
from `cloned_ptr` and `propagate_const` but there is no way to remove `const`
propagation from `polymorphic_value`.

As `polymorphic_value` is a value, `dynamic_pointer_cast`,
`static_pointer_cast` and `const_pointer_cast` are not provided.  If a
`polymorphic_value` is constructed with a custom copier or deleter, then there
is no way for a user to implement the cast operations provided for
`cloned_ptr`.


## No implicit conversions
Following design feedback, `polymorphic_value`'s constructors have been made
explicit so that surprising implicit conversions cannot take place. Any
conversion to a `polymorphic_value` must be explicitly requested by user-code. 

Matching this decision, the converting assignment operators that were present
in earlier drafts have been removed.

For a base class, `BaseClass` and derived class `DerivedClass` the converting
assignment

```
polymorphic_value<DerivedClass> derived;
polymorphic_value<Base> base = derived;
```

is no longer valid, the conversion must be made explicit:

```
polymorphic_value<DerivedClass> derived;
auto base = polymorphic_value<Base>(derived);
```

The removal of converting assigments makes `make_polymorphic_value` slightly
more verbose to use:

```
polymorphic_value<Base> base = make_polymorphic_value<DerivedClass>(args);
```

is not longer valid and must be written as

```
auto base = polymorphic_value<Base>(make_polymorphic_value<DerivedClass>(args));
```

This is somewhat cumbersome so `make_polymorphic_value` has been modified to
take an optional extra template argument allowing users to write

```
polymorphic_value<Base> base = make_polymorphic_value<Base, DerivedClass>(args);
```

The change from implicit to explicit construction is deliverately conservative.
One can change explicit constructors into implicit constructors without
breaking code (other than SFINAE checks), the reverse is not true. Similarly,
converting assignments could be added non-disruptively but not so readily
removed.

## Impact on the standard
This proposal is a pure library extension. It requires additions to be made to
the standard library header `<memory>`.

## Technical specifications

## X.X Class template `default_copy` [default.copy]

```
namespace std {
template <class T> struct default_copy {
  T* operator()(const T& t) const;
};

} // namespace std
```

The class template `default_copy` serves as the default copier for the class
template `polymorphic_value`.

The template parameter `T` of `default_copy` may be an incomplete type.

```
T* operator()(const T& t) const;
```

* _Returns_:  `new T(t)`.

## X.Y Class `bad_polymorphic_value_construction` [bad_polymorphic_value_construction]

```
namespace std {
class bad_polymorphic_value_construction : public exception
{
  public:
    bad_polymorphic_value_construction() noexcept;

    const char* what() const noexcept override;
};
}
```

Objects of type `bad_polymorphic_value_construction` are thrown to report
invalid construction of a `polymorphic_value` from a pointer argument.

```
bad_polymorphic_value_construction() noexcept;
```

* _Effects_: Constructs a `bad_polymorphic_value_construction` object.

```
const char* what() const noexcept override;
```

* _Returns_: An implementation-defined NTBS.


## X.Z Class template `polymorphic_value` [polymorphic_value]

### X.Z.1 Class template `polymorphic_value` general [polymorphic_value.general]

The `polymorphic_value` class template stores a pointer to another object.
The object pointed to by the pointer is referred to as an owned object.
`polymorphic_value` implements value semantics: the owned object is copied or
destroyed when the `polymorphic_value` is copied or destroyed.

A `polymorphic_value`, `v`, will dispose of its owned object when `v` is itself
destroyed (e.g., when leaving block scope (9.7)). 

A `polymorphic_value` object is empty if there is no owned object (The stored
pointer is `nullptr`).

Copying a non-empty `polymorphic_value` will copy the owned object so that the
copied `polymorphic_value` will have its own unique copy of the owned object.

Copying from an empty `polymorphic_value` produces another empty
`polymorphic_value`.

Copying and disposal of the owned object can be customized by supplying a
copier and deleter.

If a `polymorphic_value` is constructed from a pointer then it is said to have
a custom copier and deleter. Any `polymorphic_value` instance constructed from
another `polymorphic_value` instance constructed with a custom copier and
deleter will also have a custom copier and deleter.

The template parameter `T` of `polymorphic_value` shall be a non-union class
type. Otherwise the program is ill-formed.

The template parameter `T` of `polymorphic_value` may be an incomplete type.

[Note: Implementations are encouraged to avoid the use of dynamic memory for
ownership of small objects.]

### X.Z.2 Class template `polymorphic_value` synopsis [polymorphic_value.synopsis]

```
namespace std {
template <class T> class polymorphic_value {
 public:
  using element_type = T;

  // Constructors
  constexpr polymorphic_value() noexcept;
  
  constexpr polymorphic_value(nullptr_t) noexcept;

  template <class U> explicit polymorphic_value(U&& u);

  template <class U, class C=default_copy<U>, class D=default_delete<U>>
    explicit polymorphic_value(U* p, C c=C{}, D d=D{});

  polymorphic_value(const polymorphic_value& p);
  template <class U> 
    explicit polymorphic_value(const polymorphic_value<U>& p);
  
  polymorphic_value(polymorphic_value&& p) noexcept;
  template <class U> 
    explicit polymorphic_value(polymorphic_value<U>&& p);

  // Destructor
  ~polymorphic_value();

  // Assignment
  polymorphic_value& operator=(const polymorphic_value& p);
  polymorphic_value& operator=(polymorphic_value&& p) noexcept;

  // Modifiers
  void swap(polymorphic_value& p) noexcept;

  // Observers
  T& operator*();
  T* operator->();
  const T& operator*() const;
  const T* operator->() const;
  explicit operator bool() const noexcept;
};

// polymorphic_value creation
template <class T, class U=T, class... Ts> polymorphic_value<T>
  make_polymorphic_value(Ts&&... ts);

// polymorphic_value specialized algorithms
template<class T>
  void swap(polymorphic_value<T>& p, polymorphic_value<T>& u) noexcept;

} // end namespace std
```


### X.Z.3 Class template `polymorphic_value` constructors [polymorphic_value.ctor]

```
constexpr polymorphic_value() noexcept;
constexpr polymorphic_value(nullptr_t) noexcept;
```

* _Effects_:  Constructs an empty `polymorphic_value`.

```
template <class U> explicit polymorphic_value(U&& u);
```

* _Remarks_: Let `V` be `remove_cvref_t<U>`. This
  constructor shall not participate in overload resolution unless `V*` is
  convertible to `T*`.

* _Effects_: Constructs a `polymorphic_value` whose owned object is initialised
  with `V(std::forward<U>(u))`.

* _Throws_: Any exception thrown by the selected constructor of `V` or
  `bad_alloc` if required storage cannot be obtained.

```
template <class U, class C=default_copy<U>, class D=default_delete<U>>
  explicit polymorphic_value(U* p, C c=C{}, D d=D{});
```

* _Remarks_: This constructor shall not participate in overload resolution
  unless `U*` is convertible to `T*`.  A custom copier and deleter are said to
  be 'present' in a `polymorphic_value` initialized with this constructor.

* _Effects_: If `p` is null, creates an empty object, otherwise creates a
  `polymorphic_value` object that owns the pointer `p`.

  If `p` is non-null then the copier and deleter of the `polymorphic_value`
  constructed are initialized from `std::move(c)` and `std::move(d)`.

* _Requires_: `C` and `D` satisfy the requirements of CopyConstructible.
  If `p` is non-null then the expression `c(*p)` returns an object of type
  `U*`. The expression `d(p)` is well formed, has well defined behavior, and
  does not throw exceptions.  Either `U` and `T` must be the same type, or the
  dynamic and static type of `*p` must be the same.

* _Throws_: `bad_polymorphic_value_construction` if `is_same_v<C,
  default_copy<U>>`, `is_same_v<D, default_delete<U>>` and
  `typeid(*p)!=typeid(U)`; `bad_alloc` if required storage cannot be obtained.

* _Postconditions_:  `bool(*this) == bool(p)`.

```
polymorphic_value(const polymorphic_value& p);
template <class U> explicit polymorphic_value(const polymorphic_value<U>& p);
```

* _Remarks_: The second constructor shall not participate in overload
  resolution unless `U*` is convertible to `T*`.

* _Effects_: Creates a `polymorphic_value` object that owns a copy of the
  object managed by `p`. If `p` has a custom copier then the copy is created by
  the copier in `p`. Otherwise the copy is created by copy construction of the
  owned object.  If `p` has a custom copier and deleter then the custom copier
  and deleter of the `polymorphic_value` constructed are copied from those in
  `p`.

* _Throws_: Any exception thrown by the copier or `bad_alloc` if required
  storage cannot be obtained.

* _Postconditions_:  `bool(*this) == bool(p)`.


```
polymorphic_value(polymorphic_value&& p) noexcept;
template <class U> explicit polymorphic_value(polymorphic_value<U>&& p) noexcept;
```

* _Remarks_: The second constructor shall not participate in overload
  resolution unless `U*` is convertible to `T*`.

* _Effects_: Ownership of the resource managed by `p` is transferred to the
  constructed `polymorphic_value`.  Potentially move constructs the owned
  object (if the dynamic type of the owned object is no-throw
  move-constructible).  If `p` has a custom copier and deleter then the copier
  and deleter of the `polymorphic_value` constructed are the same as those in
  `p`.

* _Throws_: `bad_alloc` if required storage cannot be obtained.

* _Postconditions_:  `*this` contains the old value of `p`. `p` is empty.

[Note: This constructor can allow an implementation to avoid the need for
dynamic memory allocation.]

### X.Z.4 Class template `polymorphic_value` destructor [polymorphic_value.dtor]

```
~polymorphic_value();
```

* _Effects_: If get() == nullptr there are no effects. If a custom deleter `d`
  is present then `d(p)` is called and the copier and deleter are destroyed.
  Otherwise the destructor of the managed object is called.

### X.Z.5 Class template `polymorphic_value` assignment [polymorphic_value.assignment]

```
polymorphic_value& operator=(const polymorphic_value& p);
```

* _Effects_: `*this` owns a copy of the resource managed by `p`.  If `p` has a
  custom copier and deleter then the copy is created by the copier in `p`, and
  the copier and deleter of `*this` are copied from those in `p`. Otherwise the
  resource managed by `*this` is initialised by the copy constructor of the
  resource managed by `p`.

* _Throws_: Any exception thrown by the copier or `bad_alloc` if required
  storage cannot be obtained.

* _Returns_: `*this`.

* _Postconditions_:  `bool(*this) == bool(p)`.


```
polymorphic_value& operator=(polymorphic_value&& p) noexcept;
```

* _Effects_: Ownership of the resource managed by `p` is transferred to `this`.
  Potentially move constructs the owned object (if the dynamic type of the
  owned object is no-throw move-constructible).  If `p` has a custom copier and
  deleter then the copier and deleter of `*this` are the same as those in `p`.

* _Throws_: `bad_alloc` if required storage cannot be obtained.

* _Returns_: `*this`.

* _Postconditions_: `*this` contains the old value of `p`. `p` is empty.

[Note: move construction of an owned object may be used by an implementation to
avoid the need for use of dynamic memory.]

### X.Z.6 Class template `polymorphic_value` modifiers [polymorphic_value.modifiers]

```
void swap(polymorphic_value& p) noexcept;
```

* _Effects_: Exchanges the contents of `p` and `*this`.


### X.Z.7 Class template `polymorphic_value` observers [polymorphic_value.observers]

```
const T& operator*() const;
T& operator*();
```

* _Requires_: `bool(*this)`.

* _Returns_: A reference to the owned object.


```
const T* operator->() const;
T* operator->();
```

* _Requires_: `bool(*this)`.

* _Returns_: A pointer to the owned object.


```
explicit operator bool() const noexcept;
```

* _Returns_: `false` if the `polymorphic_value` is empty, otherwise `true`.

### X.Z.8 Class template `polymorphic_value` creation [polymorphic_value.creation]

```
template <class T, class U=T, class ...Ts> polymorphic_value<T>
  make_polymorphic_value(Ts&& ...ts);
```

* _Returns_: A `polymorphic_value<T>` owning an object initialised with
  `U(std::forward<Ts>(ts)...)`.

[Note: Implementations are encouraged to avoid multiple allocations.]


### X.Z.9 Class template `polymorphic_value` specialized algorithms [polymorphic_value.spec]

```
template <typename T>
void swap(polymorphic_value<T>& p, polymorphic_value<T>& u) noexcept;
```

* _Effects_: Equivalent to `p.swap(u)`.
